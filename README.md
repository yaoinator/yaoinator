ever wondered why your rentry images arent working ?   

well this might be why, due to discord getting rid of [hotlinking](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotlinking)

 " what do i do ? " simple!
use [catbox.moe](https://catbox.moe/) instead of discord for hotlinking,
<br>
you could also use [postimages.org](https://postimages.org/) or [imgur.com](https://imgur.com/) instead!

 I hope this helped ^_^ 
<br>
please stop using discord links guys...!!
